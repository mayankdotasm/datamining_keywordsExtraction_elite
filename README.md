# Exploring Keyword Extraction in NLP and Text Mining

This project aims to explore various techniques for keyword extraction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining methods. Keyword extraction is a crucial task in NLP, helping to identify the most relevant words or phrases in a document, which can enhance information retrieval and text summarization.

# sCAKE Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook (`scake_notebook.ipynb`) contains all the code and programs from the sCAKE pipeline for keyword extraction. The pipeline consists of a series of Python scripts that process documents stored in a specified folder.
You can also run the complete pipeline using the Jupyter Notebook, which integrates all the above steps for convenience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Instructions

1. Ensure you have all required dependencies installed.
   
2. Place your documents in the `data` folder.
   
3. Open the `scake_notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Execute each cell sequentially to run the pipeline.
