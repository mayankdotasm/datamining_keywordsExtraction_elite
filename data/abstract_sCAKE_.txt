Keyword Extraction is an important task in several text analysis endeavours.
In this paper, we present a critical discussion of the issues and challenges in
graph-based keyword extraction methods, along with comprehensive empirical
analysis. We propose a parameterless method for constructing graph of text that
captures the contextual relation between words. A novel word scoring method is
also proposed based on the connection between concepts. We demonstrate that
both proposals are individually superior to those followed by the sate-of-theart graph-based keyword extraction algorithms. Combination of the proposed
graph construction and scoring methods leads to a novel, parameterless keyword
extraction method (sCAKE) based on semantic connectivity of words in the
document.
Motivated by limited availability of NLP tools for several languages, we also
design and present a language-agnostic keyword extraction (LAKE) method.
We eliminate the need of NLP tools by using a statistical filter to identify
candidate keywords before constructing the graph. We show that the resulting
method is a competent solution for extracting keywords from documents of
languages lacking sophisticated NLP support.
