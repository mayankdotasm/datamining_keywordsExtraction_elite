Abstract— High-power InGaN single-quantum-well (SQW)
structure blue/green light-emitting diodes (LED’s) with an
output power of 3–5 mW were fabricated. The continuous-waveoperation of bluish-purple InGaN multiquantum-well (MQW)-structure laser diodes (LD’s) was achieved at room temperaturewith a lifetime of 35 h. The threshold current and the voltageof the LD were 80 mA and 5.5 V, respectively. Photocurrentspectra of the InGaN SQW LED’s and MQW LD’s weremeasured at room temperature. The Stokes shifts of the energydifference between the absorption and the emission energy ofthe blue/green InGaN SQW LED’s and MQW LD’s were 290,570, and 190 meV. Both spontaneous and stimulated emission ofthe LD’s originated from this deep localized energy state whichis equivalent to a quantum dot-like state. When the temperatureor the operating current of the LD’s was varied, large modehopping of the emission wavelength was observed. The carrierlifetime and the threshold carrier density were estimated to be4.7 ns and 1
/210/50/48/cm/51/59respectively. The optical conﬁnement
factor /40/0/41of the InGaN MQW LD’s was estimated to be 0.025
from the measurement of the near-ﬁeld radiation patterns.

I. INTRODUCTION
SHORT-WAVELENGTH-EMITTINGdevices,suchasblue
laser diodes (LD’s), are currently required for a number of
applications, including full-color electroluminescent displays,
laser printers, read-write laser sources for high-density infor-
mation storage on magnetic and optical media, and sourcesfor undersea optical communications. Major developmentsin wide-gap III–V nitride semiconductors have recently led
to the commercial production of high-brightness blue/green
light-emitting diodes (LED’s) [1] and to the demonstrationof room-temperature (RT) bluish-purple laser light emissionin InGaN–GaN–AlGaN-based heterostructures under pulsed
currents [2]–[8] and continuous-wave (CW) operation [9],
[10].Thesedevelopmentsarearesultoftherealizationofhigh-quality crystals of AlGaN and InGaN, and p-type conductionin AlGaN [11]–[15]. The recombination of localized excitons
has been proposed as an emission mechanism for these InGaN
quantum-well-structure LED’s [16]. The radiative recombina-tion of the spontaneous and stimulated emissions of the InGaNMQW LED’s and LD’s was attributed to excitons (or carriers)
localized at deep traps (250 meV) which originated from the
In-rich region in the InGaN wells acting as quantum dots [17].It is of interest to measure the characteristics of these RT CWoperated LD’s in detail, especially the emission mechanism,
with respect to the self-formation of InGaN quantum dots.

a 1000-˚A-thick layer of p-type Al GaN:Mg, and a 0.5-

Fig. 1 shows typical electroluminescence (EL) for blue,
green and yellow SQW LED’s with different indium molefractions in the InGaN well layer obtained at a forward currentof 20 mA [1]. The indium mole fraction of the InGaN well
layer of the blue SQW LED’s was 0.3. The peak wavelength
and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for the typicalblue SQW LED’s are 450 and 30 nm, respectively, thosefor the green SQW LED’s are 520 and 35 nm, respectively,
and those for the yellow SQW LED’s are 600 and 50 nm,
respectively. The EL peak energy for the green SQW LED’sexhibited blue shifts of about 100 meV as the driving currentwas increased from 1 to 80 mA, as shown in Fig. 2. Similar
blue shifts were obtained for both the blue and yellow SQW
LED’s. When the peak wavelength increases, the FWHM ofthe EL spectra increases, probably due to the inhomogeneitiesin the InGaN layer or the strain between the well and the
barrier layers of the SQW, which is caused by the lattice

mismatch and differences between the thermal expansion
coefﬁcients of the well and the barrier layers. At 20 mA,
the output power and the external quantum efﬁciency of the
blue SQW LED’s are 5 mW and 9.1%, respectively. Those of
the green SQW LED’s are 3 mW and 6.3%, respectively. A
typical on-axis luminous intensity of the green SQW LED’s
for a 10 C conical viewing angle is 10 cd at 20 mA.
These values of output power, external quantum efﬁciency and
luminous intensity for blue/green SQW LED’s are the highest
yet reported.
Photocurrent (PC) spectra of the blue and green SQW
LED’s were measured to assign the emission and absorption
energy levels. Monochromatic light was focused on the epi-
taxial wafer of each device structure and the PC spectrumwas measured. Fig. 3 shows the PC spectra and EL spectra
of the blue and green InGaN SQW LED’s. The EL of the
LED’s was measured at a current of 20 mA at RT [1]. The
peak wavelengths of the EL of the blue and green InGaN
SQW LED’s were 453 nm (2.73 eV) and 520 nm (2.38 eV),
respectively, as shown in spectra (c) and (d). Both PC spectra
(a) and (b) show a strong peak at a wavelength around 360
nm (3.44 eV) which is due to an absorption of the thick
GaN layers. In the PC spectra there are also shoulder-like
peaks at 410 nm (3.02 eV) for the blue (a) and 420 nm
(2.95 eV) for the green SQW LED’s (b). These shoulder-
like peaks are probably due to the absorption at the
1
electron heavy-hole excitonic transition of the quantum energy
level in the InGaN well layer [16], [17]. The Stokes shifts
between the absorption due to the 1 quantum energy
state and the EL of the blue and green SQW LED’s were 290
and 570 meV, respectively. When the In-composition ratio
of the InGaN well layer increases, In-composition ﬂuctuation
increases and an energy tail of the absorption spectra to
a lower energy state is formed due to an InGaN phase
separation during the growth [19]. Then, the width of the
PC spectrum of green LED’s (b) becomes broad and the
peak wavelength is almost the same for the blue and green
LED’s. All of the EL appears at this lower energy tail of the

absorption spectra resulting from In-composition ﬂuctuation.
These results indicate that the EL of blue and green SQW
LED’s originates from the carrier recombination at the deep
localized states with localization energies of 290 meV and 570meV, respectively. These localized states are equivalent to athree-dimensionally conﬁned quantum dot-like state. The blue
shift of the EL of the SQW LED’s with increasing forward
current (see Fig. 2) is probably due to a band-ﬁlling effect ofthese deep localized states.

The InGaN MQW LD device consisted of a 300- ˚A-thick
GaN buffer layer grown at a low temperature of 550 C,
a3 -m-thick layer of n-type GaN:Si, a 0.1- m-thick layer
of n-type In GaN:Si, a 0.5- m-thick layer of n-type
AlGaN:Si, a 0.1- m-thick layer of n-type GaN:Si,
an InGaN–InGaN MQW structure consisting of
three35- ˚A-thick Si-dopedIn GaNwelllayers forminga
gain medium separated by 70- ˚A-thick Si-doped In GaN
barrier layers, a 200- ˚A-thick layer of p-type Al GaN:Mg,
a 0.1-m-thick layer of p-type GaN:Mg, a 0.5- m-thick layer
of p-type Al GaN:Mg, and a 0.3- m-thick layer of p-
typeGaN:Mg.The 0.1- m-thick n-typeandp-type GaN layers
were light-guiding layers. The 0.5- m-thick n-type and p-type
AlGaN layers acted as cladding layers for conﬁnement
of the carriers and the light emitted from the active region
of the InGaN MQW structure. The structure of the ridge-geometry InGaN MQW LD was almost the same as thatdescribed previously [6].
First, the surface of the p-type GaN layer was partially
etcheduntilthen-typeGaNlayerandthep-typeAl

reported previously [2]. The area of the ridge-geometry LD

contact was evaporated onto the p-type GaN layer, and a
Ti–Al contact was evaporated onto the n-type GaN layer. Theelectrical characteristics of the LD’s fabricated in this waywere measured under a direct current (DC). The structure ofthe InGaN MQW LD’s is shown in Fig. 4. The Stokes shift of
this LD between the absorption due to the
1 QW energy
state of the PC spectra and the laser emission was 190 meV,as described below.
Fig. 5 shows the PC spectra of three kinds of InGaN MQW
LD’s which were grown under the same conditions except
for the In composition of the InGaN well layers. The Incompositions of the InGaN well layer of the LD’s were (a)0.10, (b) 0.12, and (c) 0.20. By comparing the PC spectraof the LD’s in Fig. 5 with those of blue and green InGaN
SQW LED’s in Fig. 3, we determined that the 343 nm (3.62
eV) peak is due to an absorption of Al
GaN cladding
layers, the 366 nm (3.39 eV) peak is due to an absorption ofGaN guiding layers and In
GaN barrier layers, and (a)
the 386 nm (3.21 eV), and (b), (c) 390 nm (3.18 eV) peaks
are due to the absorption at the 1 electron heavy-hole
excitonic transition in the InGaN well layers. The stimulatedemissions of these LD’s appearingat (a) 390nm (3.18 eV), (b)401 nm (3.09 eV), and (c) 419 nm (2.96 eV), were positionedat the lower energy tail region of the absorption spectra of the
PC spectrum. The Stokes shifts between the absorption due to
the
1 QW energy state and the laser emission were (a) 30
meV, (b) 90 meV, and (c) 220 meV. When the In compositionof the InGaN well layers increases, the PC spectra show
broad spectrum width and have the lower energy tail in the
longerwavelengthregionduetothephaseseparationofInGaNduring the growth [19]. This means thatthe laser emission alsooriginates from carrier recombination at a deep localized stateof the
1two-dimensional(2-D)InGaNQWstate,whichis

shift becomes larger with increasing In composition becausethe emission originates from the localized states formed inthe In-rich region in the InGaN well layer due to the In-

carriers becomes much smaller when the In composition is
lower than 0.12. This means that the phase separation of

The In composition of this LD was 0.15 and the Stokes
shift between the absorption due to the 1 QW energy
state of the PC spectra and the laser emission was 190
meV. No stimulated emission was observed up to a thresholdcurrent of 80 mA, which corresponded to a threshold current
density of 3.6 kA/cm
, as shown in Fig. 6. The operating
voltage at the threshold current was 5.5 V. We were ableto reduce the operating voltage signiﬁcantly, in comparison
with values obtained previously (about 20–30 V), by adjusting438 IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 3, NO. 2, APRIL 1997

the growth, Ohmic contact and doping proﬁle conditions
[2]–[7]. In the previous structures, the InGaN well and barrierlayers were undoped [2]–[7]. In the present structures, Siwas doped into these layers to reduce the threshold current
density (from about 10 to 3.6 kA/cm
) and operating voltage.
Recently, the recombination of excitons localized at certainpotential minima in an InGaN quantum well was proposedas the emission mechanism for InGaN SQW LED’s and
MQW LED’s [16], [17]. It was suggested that these localized
excitons, or zero-dimensional quantum dots, were related tothe emission mechanism for InGaN MQW LD’s [16], [17].The exact effect of Si doping is not clear at present. However,
there is a possibility that Si doping enhances the formation
of a localized state and, as a result, a quantum-dot-like statein the InGaN well layer. Also, the temperature of thermalannealing for Mg-doped GaN and AlGaN layers to activate
Mg acceptors was changed from 700
C to 600 C after
evaporation of Ni–Au metal in order to reduce the contactresistanceofthep-electrode[13].Thelow-temperaturethermalannealing probably prevents dissociation of GaN and InGaN
layers [13].
Fig. 7 shows the results of a lifetime test of CW-operated
LD’s carried out at RT, in which the operating current isshown as a function of time under a constant output power
of 1.5 mW per facet controlled using an autopower controller
(APC). The operating current increases gradually due to theincrease in the threshold current from the initial stage andsharply after 35 h. This short lifetime is probably due to the
largeheatgenerationresultingfromthehighoperatingcurrents
and voltages. Breakdown of the LD’s occurred after a periodof more than 35 h due to the formation of a short circuit inthe LD’s. This short lifetime is probably caused by a high
threshold current density (3.6 kA/cm
) and a high operating
voltage through the high heat generation at the active layer.
Next, the emission spectra of the LD’s were measured
under RT CW operation at an output power of 1 mW.
An optical spectrum analyzer (ADVANTEST Q8347), which
utilized the Fourier-transform spectroscopy method by meansofaMichelsoninterferometer,wasusedtomeasurethespectra

observed. The origin of these subband emissions has not yet
been clariﬁed. However, it is possible that these emissions
result from transitions between quantum dot subband energylevels,asmentionedabove.Severalpeakswithadifferentpeakseparation (energy separation of 1–5 meV) from that of the
longitudinal mode appeared under pulsed current operation, as
described in our previous reports [3], [5]–[7]. These subbandemissionswith anenergy separation of 1–5meV arecausedbymode hopping between adjacent QW or quantum dot subband
energy levels due to the pulsed current operation, as shown in
Figs. 13 and 14. At
1.2, the main peak at 405.83 nm
becomes dominant, as shown in Fig. 8(b).
The temperature dependence of the emission spectra was
measured between 20 C and 60 C under CW operation
with a constant output power of 1 mW, as shown in Fig. 9.Large mode hopping of the peak emission wavelength withan energy step of 1–5 meV is observed, which results from
the temperature dependence of the gain proﬁle. Mode hopping
occurs between the subband emissions, which is probably aresult of the transitions between adjacent QW or quantumdot subbands, as shown in Fig. 8. The change in the actual
emission spectra with temperature between 47

the change in the gain proﬁle. The peak stimulated emission
always appears at the peak of each subband emission.

2 meV). The origin of these subband emissions has not yetbeen clariﬁed in detail. However, it is possible that theseemissions result from transitions between quantum dot-likesubband energy levels, as mentioned above. On increasingthe forward current from 156 to 186 mA, the laser emissionbecomes a single mode and shows mode hopping of the peak
wavelength toward higher energy, and the peak emission is at
the center of each subband emission. Fig. 12 shows the peak

wavelength of the laser emission as a function of the operating
current under RT CW operation. The gradual increase of thepeak wavelength occurs probably due to band-gap narrowingof the active layer caused by the temperature increase. At
certain currents, large mode hopping of the peak wavelength
toward higher energy is observed with increasing operatingcurrent.
Under pulsed current operation, laser emission appears from
all of these subband emissions because the operating current
is modulated from zero to the peak with a pulse width of 0.5
s and duty ratio of 20%, as shown in Fig. 13. Fig. 14 shows
the peak wavelength of the maximum peak as a function of
the operating pulsed current. The gradual increase of the peak
wavelength with increasing operating current seen in Fig. 12is not observed in Fig. 14 because the generation of heat issmallunderpulsedoperation.Thepeakwavelengthalsoshows
the same mode hopping toward higher energy with increasing
operating current under pulsed operation as shown in Figs. 11and 12. Several peaks with different peak separations (energyseparation of 1–5 meV) from that of the longitudinal mode
appeared under pulsed current operation, as described in our
previous reports [3], [5], [7]. The origin of these subbandemissions has not yet been clariﬁed exactly. These subbandemissions with an energy separation of 1–5 meV are caused
by mode hopping probably between adjacent quantum dot-
like subband energy levels under a pulsed current operation,as shown in Figs. 13 and 14.440 IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 3, NO. 2, APRIL 1997

Next, the delay time of the laser emission of the LD’s as a

was almost same as the previous value of 3.2 ns [7]. The
threshold carrier density was estimated to be 1
10/cmfor a threshold current density of 3.6 kA/cm ,a
carrier lifetime of 4.7 ns, and an active layer thickness of 105
˚A [7]. The thickness of the active layer was determined as
105˚A assuming that the injected carriers were conﬁned in
the InGaN well layers in the active layer. Typical values are
3 ns, 1 kA/cm and 210/cmfor

In comparison with these values for conventional lasers,
for our structure is relatively large (two orders of magnitude
higher), probably due to the large density of states of carriersresulting from their large effective masses [20].
Fig. 16 shows typical near-ﬁeld radiation patterns (NFP)
for the InGaN MQW LD’s in the planes parallel and per-
pendicular to the junction. The beam full-width at half-power(FWHP) values for the parallel and perpendicular NFP’s were1.2 and 0.4
m, respectively. The astigmatism of the laser
diodes depends on the optical mode proﬁle, which in turn
is determined by the laser structure. A typical value of theastigmatism was 2
m. From the NFP perpendicular to the
junction , the optical conﬁnement factor of the InGaN
MQW LD’s was estimated to be 0.025 by calculating the ratio
of the integrated area of the NFP within three InGaN welllayers to the integrated whole area of the NFP within thewhole structure.

ONCLUSION
By combining a high-power blue InGaN SQW LED, a
green InGaN SQW LED and a red AlInGaP LED, many
applications, such as LED full-color displays and LED whitelamps for use in place of light bulbs or ﬂuorescent lamps,withcharacteristicsofhighreliability,high-durabilityandlow-
energy consumption can now be realized. The Stokes shifts
of energy differences between the exciting and the emissionenergy of the blue and green InGaN SQW LED’s were aslarge as 290 and 570 meV, respectively, at RT. This indicates
that the energy depth of the localized states, where the carriers
recombine to give rise to spontaneous emissions, is 290–570meV in the InGaN QW states. These localized states areequivalent to a quantum-dot-like state.
The RT CW operation of InGaN MQW LD’s with a
lifetime of 35 h was demonstrated. The Stokes shifts of energydifferences between the exciting and the emission energy of

the InGaN MQW LD’s were as large as 30 meV for
0.10, 90 meV for 0.12, 190 meV for 0.14, and
220 meV for at RT, where is an In mole
fraction of the In GaN well layers. A deep localized
state (the localization energy is higher than 100 meV) which isequivalent to a quantum-dot-like state was formed when the In
compositionof theInGaNwelllayerwas higherthan0.14,due
to the InGaN phase separation during the growth [16], [17].Both the spontaneous emission and the stimulated emission ofthe LD’s originated from these deep localized energy states.
Using high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), a periodic indium composition ﬂuctuationwas observed, which was probably caused by InGaN phaseseparation during growth [16], [17]. Based on these results,
the laser emission is considered to originate from the InGaN
quantum-dot-likestates.Themanyperiodicsubbandemissionsprobably result from the transitions between the subbandenergy levels of the InGaN quantum dots formed from In-
rich regions in the InGaN well layers. We estimated the size
of the InGaN dots to be approximately 35 ˚A using high-
resolution cross-sectional TEM [17]. These InGaN quantumdots were self-organized due to the phase separation during
InGaN growth. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to control the size of
InGaN dots that are composed of adjacent In-rich and -poorregions. The energy separation of each subband emission isonly about 1–5 meV which is considered to be relatively small
in comparison with the energy difference between the
1
and 2 subband energy transitions of the quantum dots.
These periodic subband energy levels are probably causedby the transitions of the
1 subband energy levels of
a number of quantum dots with different dot sizes. The
optical conﬁnement factor of the InGaN MQW LD’s was
estimated to be 0.025 from the measurement of the NFP.

Shuji Nakamura was born in Ehime, Japan, on
May 22, 1954. He received the B.E., M.S., and
Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from theUniversity of Tokushima, Japan in 1977, 1979, and
1994, respectively.
In 1979, he joined Nichia Chemical Industries
Ltd. Since that time, he has studied optoelectronic
materials and devices in the research and devel-
opment department of the company. In 1988, he
spent a year at the University of Florida as a
VisitingResearchAssociate.HestartedIII–Vnitride
research in 1989 and succeeded in developing a blue LED with a luminousintensity as high as 2 cd using III–V nitride materials in 1993. In 1995,
he developed high-brightness single-quantum-well structure blue and green
LED’s with a luminous intensity of 2 cd and 10 cd, respectively. These
luminous intensities are about 100 times higher than those of conventional
blue SiC LED’s and green GaP LED’s. In 1995, he also developed a bluish-
purplelaserdiodeusingIII–Vnitridematerialsfortheﬁrsttime.Atpresent,he
is responsible for all aspects of III–V nitride research for blue/green LED’s
and LD’s at Nichia Chemical.
